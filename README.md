## Why?
For this specific APP. We wanted a user who has access to the APP, to be able to browse through
pre-existing Recipes. While browsing, we wanted the user to be able to add a favorite recipe to the users favorite
recipe choices. As well as add a recipe to the users personal cookbook. Lastly if the user wanted to make the recipe.
The user should be able to verify that the user has enough ingredients to make that recipe.
